    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Wilma Hjortås and i am 24 years old. I am from Barnarp, a small
      suburb 15 minutes from Jönköping, but in May 2022 i moved in to the city
      of Jönköping. I study New media design at Jönköpigs univeristy, i started
      this august so i have three amazing years ahead of me. In my sparetime i
      like to spend time with my friends and family, and cuddle up with my
      newphew and niece. I also enjoy working out, both in the gym and on the
      soccerfield.
