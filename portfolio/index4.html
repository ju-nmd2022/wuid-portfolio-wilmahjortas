                <p class="branding">
                    Cece cosmetics was founded in 2020 by two cousins Maya 
                    and Noa. Since they were little kids they have always been 
                    interested in skincare and make-up. As they got older the 
                    interest grew and they both wanted to make a living by 
                    doing what they loved. Maya started studying to become a 
                    make-up artist and Noa a skin therapist. During this time 
                    they started to discuss the market and how it was lacking 
                    good high-end products that were 100% eco-friendly and 
                    at the same time cruelty-free and vegan. This was the time 
                    when their thoughts of starting their own cosmetics brand 
                    started to bloom. The conversations about it got more and 
                    more serious, but they did not get the support from their 
                    family as they were hoping for, except from their Grand
                    -
                    mother Cecilia. Cecilia has always supported them in 
                    everything they have done through life, and has always said 
                    to them to follow their dreams. She is one of the reasons 
                    Maya and Noa ventured to quit their jobs and become 
                    independent. Picking the name was therefore easy, Cece has 
                    always been there.
